UNRELEASED CHANGES
******************
* CIP-2660 Added back FspPstSubarray to MCS
* CIP-2953 increase SV pod storage from 375Mi to 2Gi
* CIP-2659: CbfController On/Off command partial success
  * On command succeeds if one or more LRUs are powered on; Off command succeeds if one or more LRUs are powered off
  * Controller OpState is ON if one or more LRUs are powered on, and only OFF once all LRUs are powered off and Off command is fully successful
  * wait_for_blocking_results allows partial success of blocking LRCs
  * Configurable HPS device timeouts in charts: CbfController, FspCorrSubarray, SlimLink, Vcc
* CIP-2828 Added attribute lastHpsScanConfiguration for output configuration string and validation tests.
* CIP-2899: Refactored adminMode push event to be changed after communication has been established
* 19-11-2024: Added attribute change event mocking for unit tests to MockDeviceBuilder, MockCommand
* CIP-2816: Removed global constants for default max capabilities, throw error when not defined
* CIP-3048: 
  * renamed "channel_offset" param to more explicit "spead_channel_offset", and forced uint32 underflow before writing to SPEAD descriptor; previously we were relying on the Tango attribute write value in the FSP Corr app to underflow
  * added double scan with same config integration test
  * fixed controller On/Off command always calling every SLIM regardless of previous partial success
* CIP-2809: replaced all custom assertions with ska-tango-testing assertions, deleted custom assertions

1.0.0
******
* CIP-1924 Upgrade to ska-tango-base v1.0.0
  * Created base classes for observing and non-observing devices (CbfObsDevice, CbfDevice) and component managers (CbfObsComponentManager, CbfComponentManager)
    * CbfObsDevice implements reduced subarray ObsState model, removing EMPTY and RESOURCING states for non-subarray devices.
  * Converted base component managers to inherit from TaskExecutorComponentManager
  * Converted the following commands/methods to queued LRCs/submitted tasks:
    * start_communicating
    * CbfController: On, Off, InitSysParam
    * CbfSubarray: update_sys_param, AddReceptors, RemoveReceptors, RemoveAllReceptors, ConfigureScan, Scan, EndScan, GoToIdle, Abort, ObsReset, Restart
    * Vcc: ConfigureBand, ConfigureScan, Scan, EndScan, GoToIdle, Abort, ObsReset
    * Fsp: SetFunctionMode, AddSubarrayMembership, RemoveSubarrayMembership
    * FspCorrSubarray: ConfigureScan, Scan, EndScan, GoToIdle, Abort, ObsReset
    * Slim: On, Off, Configure
    * SlimLink: ConnectTxRx, DisconnectTxRx
    * TalonLRU: On, Off
    * PowerSwitch: TurnOnOutlet, TurnOffOutlet
  * Removed the following commands:
    * Standby command removed across the board
    * CbfSubarray: On, Off
    * Vcc: On, Off
    * Fsp: On, Off
    * FspCorrSubarray: On, Off
    * TalonBoard: On, Off
  * Improvements in control flow:
    * Only Tango Devices that are directly controlling hardware can receive ON/OFF commands e.g. TalonLRU, and not Vcc
    * In  Tango Devices that do not receive ON/OFF commands, once communication with the component is established the OpState becomes ON. This is all achieved when start_communicating method is called as part of setting the Tango Device's AdminMode to ONLINE. In these cases, essentially ON means the device is communicating with it's subordinate device.
    * Moved AdminMode control of obs devices (Vcc, Fsp, FspCorrSubarray) from CbfController to CbfSubarray, during the following subarray commands:
      * Vcc AdminMode ONLINE/OFFLINE during AddReceptors/RemoveReceptors
      * Fsp AdminMode ONLINE/OFFLINE during ConfigureScan/GoToIdle
      * FspCorrSubarray ONLINE/OFFLINE set by Fsp during ConfigureScan/GoToIdle
    * State changing callbacks consistently use locks to avoid race conditions.
      * Component managers do not update state machines directly; only callbacks (implemented at the device level) are passed to the component managers.
  * Improvements in tests:
    * More thorough unit tests provide better low-level coverage for individual devices, including failure mechanisms.
    * Redundant subordinate device integration tests deprecated in favour of more comprehensive and holistic tests only at the highest levels of MCS (Controller and Subarray).
    * ska-tango-testing better leveraged to align our testing framework with the rest of the SKAO:
      * ska_tango_testing.context basis for unit testing harness
      * TangoEventTracer used along with custom defined change event assertions to validate event-driven device behaviour.

* CIP-2732 Added supported interface validation and documentation updates
  * Added validation for supported schema versions specified in the interface parameter for commands in MCS.
  * Added sphinx directive to generate tables for documentation
* CIP-2616 MCS ADR-99 Scan Configuration Validation Updates
  * Abstracted out the Scan Configuration Validation in Subarray into a separate class  
  * Updated the Validations and added new validations to support ADR-99/v4.1 Interface Changes
  * Refer to new MCS restrictions here: https://confluence.skatelescope.org/display/SE/Validation+of+Scan+Configuration+against+Supported+Configurations

* CIP-2504 Updated for mid.cbf CSP ConfigureScan 3.0 telescope model changes
  * Removed validation for tdc fields (removed from telescope model)
  * Removed validation for doppler_phase_corr_subscription_point (removed from
    telescope model)
  * Removed check for existence of delay_model_subscription (mandatory in telmodel)
  * Removed validation and setting zoom_factor and zoom_window_tuning

    * Removed from telescope model
    * Class properties remain, to be removed in base class update
    * zoom_factor set to 0 for downstream HPS config, this will be set later
      when zoom is implemented from the channel_width parameter introduced in 
      ADR-99

  * Added cross validation for cbf.fsp.output_port for the incoming ConfigureScan
  * Removed setting fsp subarray values from parameters removed from schema
  * Updated ConfigureScan unit test data to interface 3.0
